      <h2>The Forest Grove</h2>

        The trees part, revealing a small clearing in the middle of the forest.
        In the centre, a <Sub c={lookStones}>ring of stones</Sub> circles a{" "}
        <Sub c={lookTree}>tree taller than the rest</Sub>. Otherwise, the only
        notable feature is the path, which spreads from one road into many. The
        path splits in four directions:

      <ul>

          <Travel>Forward, towards the foot of the mountain</Travel>

        </li>
        <li>
          <Travel>East, deeper into the forest</Travel>
        </li>
