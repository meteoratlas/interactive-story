      <p>
        Dense pine boards scored by wind and sand, the humble shack lies
        situated atop a small outcropping of rocks overlooking the sea. Its roof
        is half-collapsed, and if anyone ever lived here they are gone now. The
        windows are painted with permanent haze and{" "}
        <Sub c={lookRubble}>a pile of rubble</Sub> sits adjacent, either a
        forgotten repair or the natural accumulation of debris that slowly
        engulfs any house. {shackStatus()} Somewhere in the distance, a{" "}
        <Sub c={lookGull}>gull</Sub> cries out. The path you trod to get here
        winds back down, inviting a{" "}
        <Travel to={() => setState(prev => ({ ...prev, page: <Seaside /> }))}>
          return to the shore.
