      <p>
        The air is stale and still, and despite the long-abandoned state of the
        shack it has an intangible sensation of comfort. It is a single room,
        containing only a desk and a <Sub c={lookBed}>bed</Sub>. Cobwebs litter
        the corners of the ceiling, and dust lines each surface. On a desk below
        a window sits a <Sub c={lookPhoto}>framed photograph</Sub> and a few
        assorted <Sub c={lookKnacks}>knick-knacks</Sub>. The door leads{" "}

          back out to the beach.
